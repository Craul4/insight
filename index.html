      <p>
        Karma is a cycle. It never started and it will never end. The fact that
        you are carrying your ancestors "karma" can be pretty obvious to pretty
        much everyone by now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Psychology can explain inherited "behaviors" that are carried from a
        generation to the next.
        <strong>'He's just like his grandfather/father/etc'</strong> Thus we can
        conclude that a kind of generational "karma" that we inherited from our
        ancestors exists. Their actions and decisions from tenths and hundreds
        of years ago influence ourselves today. We have no control over this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Medicine can explain inherited illness.
        <strong
          >"People that have ancestors with x disease have a y% greater chance
          of developing x disease."</strong
        >
        Again, we can conclude that a kind of generational "karma" exists. The
        genetic make-up that we inherited from tenths and hundreds of years ago
        influence our own internal structure and can trigger illness. Again, we
        have no control over this.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can thus conclude that each of us carry a generational karma with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        But why do we experience these karmas? Why do some human beings get born
        into ideal families with little generational karma and some have to
        carry great emotional and physical baggage from the past?
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, you can argue that everybody has problems and nobody has a
        perfect family, but it is fairly obvious that some human beings have it
        "worse" than others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it possible that there's some kind of before-life karma that we carry
        with us when we incarnate?
      </p>
      <p>
        A past life, unexplainable (currently) by science,medicine,psychology?
      </p>
      <p>
        A past life karma that maybe decides the type of generational karma that
        you are born into?
      </p>
      <p>Some sort of <strong>cosmic balance</strong>.</p>
      <p>
        These questions can not yet be proven and decidedly answered but I
        believe the answer lies in each of us. You just have to sit and listen.
